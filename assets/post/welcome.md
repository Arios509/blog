## About my first post

This is totally a new blog for me, but i will try to kept my old post and build here again. This is definitely a good start.

After this few days of trying, i was able to finish the navigation bar, not to mention my **[friend](https://github.com/CodeTropolis)** who give me the idea of the routerLinkActive and help me solve the navigation problem.

This wasn't the first time i build a blog, but previously all based on a ready platform, like **Wordpress**, **Blogger**, or **Ghost**. Not to say there are not a good platform, just for me to use something like this is too complicated and maybe are too wasted.

### This is my oldest blog

 I remember that I was 16 yo, which still study in secondary school. And I alwasy fancy about those Technology things, and wonder maybe I can build something powerful too. Yet i was too young. Everything doesn't go like what i was dream of, that are more cruel than i can tell. I tried to restart writing a blog with **Digital Ocean** which is a cloud service provider, and this doesn't go very long. Because I was purchase for VM and everything need to set up by own, that's not a problem because i am a system administrator. 

 Let's take the **WordPress** as the example, I research for the themes, and those themes are very pretty when show in their description pages. Whenever i want to use that, the theme will become like stupid simplest layout. And i try many time is that my configurations part got problems, but it wasn't. That kind of frustrated let me quit, and for the month, the fee to pay for **Digital Ocean** wasted. 

 ### Until I discover Github Pages

Shame to say that, I like technologies, but I have an old concept that everything need to study from scratch and build it. Similar thing can say is like rebuild the **CIRCLE**. As a frontend developer, until now only discover the beauty of the **Markdown**. I feel late for it. I didn't know until now, that website can transform this markdown format to HTML and this can easy done. Plus, I finally know that's how to publish a page to the **GitHub** and use it as my personal blog which is pretty damn cool. 

With the GitHub pages and Markdown language, it turns me back on to rewrite this blog. Another one, I need to thanks is [FireShip IO](https://fireship.io/), this gave me a lot of idea and basic info about those new language and how to apply it. I take this website as a template and try to make another cool version from it.

Anyway, this site still haven't finish yet. Still have a lot need to build for, record down for this checkpoint.

PS : This is draw by me through **Procreate**
